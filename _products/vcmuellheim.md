I designed and maintain our clubs' website using GitHub pages as cornerstone.
News, teams and club members are modularized as Jekyll collections. The page is connected to Forestry.io, which serves as headless CMS. This allows non-techie members intuitively create news posts and update their teams' details.
We integrated with the German SAMS volleyball server. Teams, rankings and match informations are periodically fetched and cached.
New blog posts and match results are automatically shared on our social pages.
